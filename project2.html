								<p> During this project, my group and I were tasked with creating an AI chatbot to help the general public.
									We performed needfinding through our surveys to determine what chatbot to make and what features it should have.
									After building the prototype we performed usability testing and found more areas of improvement. We created a final
									version of the prototype based on the first round of the user testing and users in the second round of user testing
									were much more satisfied. Although there still exists issues with the chatbot, we are proud to have made a service
									that could help people live healthier lives.
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/p2prompt.jpg" alt="" /></div>

								</p>

								<p> We started by first brainstorming possible chatbots. We drew on our own personal expereinces to come up with chatbots
									that would be useful to the normal person. We also considered how feasible it was to build the chatbots when narrowing
									down our list. We brainstormed using a mindmap to organize our ideas. After brainstorming, we decided to create a survey
									using google forms to see which one of our final contenders: a healthy recipe chatbot, gym chatbot, or panic/first aid
									chatbot would be most well received by the general public. Me and Tiffany were in charge of the survey.  We asked general questions such as "I struggle to exercise"
									or "I struggle to eat healthy" as well as more chatbot specific questions like "what features would you like to see on a
									[insert chatbot]". The results showed that students were most interested in the recipe chatbot. The the most wanted features
									on the recipe chatbot include being able to list dietary preferences (like being vegan) and to suggest recipes
									based on available ingredients. Below are some of the statistics from our survey that helped us make our design decision for
									the chatbot.

								</p>
								<p>
									From the survey results, a POVs and personas was created. The first persona was Vanessa, a busy and successful woman who does
									not have much time to cook. The second persona is Sam, a poor college student who finds it hard to come up with recipes using
									the limited ingredients he had on-hand. Vanessa's needs would be solved by the ability of the chatbot to quickly come up with
									vegetarian recipes so she does not have to spend time in her busy schedule to decide what to eat. Sam needs would be met by
									the chatbot's ability to find recipes based his limited array of ingedients. We also made storyboards for the 2 personas demonstrating
									how the chatbot would be used by them.

									The first itereation of the chatbot inlcuded the options to display recipes based on the ingredients available to the user
									and the user's dietary preferences. We built it using rasa as recommended. I was apart of the team that handled user testing.
									For the first iteration of the chatbot, we had 5 testers (as recommended in the slides) come and test out the chatbot. 
									They would perform the thinking out loud protocol to help us understand what a user would expect from this chatbot. We also
									used the codiscovery protocol to help out our testers when the bot didn't work. The major issues with the bot that we had found
									from testing included the user not knowing the expected prompts for the bot, having to reload the tab to search a new recipe, 
									and not having error messages that would tell the user that no recipes were found. Below are the screen and face recordings of one of 
									our testers.

								</p>

								<p>
									We made improvements to the chatbot using the feedback we had gotten from the first round of user testing. Some of the improvements we had made
									included more clear prompts, being able to search the recipe by food names, error messaging if no recipes are found, and being able to 
									make mulitple recipe queries without restarting the chatbot. These changes were well received by our second round of user testers. There are some
									issues left like no mute option for the reading voice. Below is a gif demo of the final version of our chatbot.

								<p>
									My personal contributions included: creating the user surveys, performing the first round of user testing, creating some of the powerpoint
									slides, and presenting the final presentation. This project was a valuable lesson in time management. Since our team all had midterms, it
									was crucial that we start early. Especially when you have portions of the project that can only be done once another group member has done theirs.
									Despite the tight deadlines we were able to work harmoniously. Also, I learned the importance of being prepared for user testing. If you do not
									had a structured plan for how you users will test, the data that you collect will not be as helpful. Thankfully my first user tester was patient
									and helped me to understand what and how to test the chatbot. Our team is very proud of our final prototype and this was another valuable 
									learning experience!
