								<p> During this project, my group and I were tasked with making an existing service here at HKUST more user-friendly.
									In doing so, we had to brainstorm areas of improvement at HKUST, pick a particular service, and survey HKUST students to see what issues can be fixed.
									Afterwards, we brainstormed solutions to that service using our research and began creating prototypes and storyboards to express our solutions. Ultimately,
									want to develop a solution that would realistically solve a human-interation issue here at HKUST.

								<p>
									We started first by brainstorming what we wanted out topic to be. Drawing on our own personal experience, we decided to tackle the issues of
									eating at HKUST canteens. Our group brainstormed a variety of questions that we would send out to HKUST students to identify what their pain points
									were and thus how we could solve them. Coming up with good questions to ask people is rather difficult as you have to make sure they are easy
									to understand and unbiased without losing meaning. Our group made mulitple tweaks to the final set of questions before we released them. 
									Below is the mind map we used to brainstorm the survey questions.
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/mindmap.JPG" alt="" /></div>

									Next, we had to analyze the data from the questions. We discovered 4 major pain points: lack of seating, lack of ingredient/allergen transparency,
									long wait times, and inefficient in-person ordering. Analyzing the data actually was not too hard since nearly all the responses fell into these 4
									categories. From these findings, we started to develop our mockups and storyboards.

								</p>
								<p>
									We decided to solve these pain points by building upon the existing online ordering feating on the HKUST student app. Through the app, students would be
									able to order their meals online. The improved app would have food allergen as well as seating capacity info. It would also have an ETA pickup time for
									the meal to help students skip lines. This would solve the issue of long wait times. We make mockups of the existing app with these new features included.
									We also made personas and storyboards to illustrate how these mockups would be used. Below are some examples of our work.

								</p>

								<p>
									My personal contributions included: brainstorming survey questions, sending our surveys, creating the soltuions slides, and presenting. In this project,
									I learned alot about the design process. As students of HKUST ourselves, it can be quite easy to jump to a certain soltuion since we have our own 
									complaints about dining. But in our research we discovered things that we had not considered before like how important it is to display allergen info.
									This shows how important it is to properly perform each step of the design process to make sure your final results are representative of the target goal.
									Also, I learned alot of about time and team management. University life is busy and hectic, making it hard for all of us to meet and work together. But,
									once proper communication was estabilished and expectations were set, progress generally followed. For example, having someone book a room for use to work
									in was a great boost to our productivity as we could make group decisions fast. All in all, this was an informative experience and I enjoyed working with
									my team!
